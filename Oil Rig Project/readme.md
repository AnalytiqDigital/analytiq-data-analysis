 🛢️ Oil Rig Performance Dashboard | Power BI

 📌 Executive Summary
This project presents an automated operational performance dashboard built in Power BI to support data-driven decision-making across multiple oil rig locations.

The dashboard provides leadership with real-time visibility into:
- Productivity
- Cost efficiency
- Quality performance
- Workforce training

This enables faster intervention, improved accountability, and reduced manual reporting effort.



 🖥️ Dashboard Overview

![Oil Rig Performance Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c977be15-8bba-4a29-ab3a-d5c77b65c838)

A single-page executive view designed to answer critical operational questions at a glance:

- Are rigs meeting productivity targets?
- Where are costs exceeding expectations?
- Which locations have quality or training risks?
- How does performance compare across rigs?



 📊 Key Performance Areas

- Productivity  
  Units Per Hour (UPH) vs target

- Cost Efficiency  
  Cost per unit produced vs budget

- Quality  
  Units per issue and total quality incidents

- Workforce Development  
  Training hours achieved vs target

- Operations Scale  
  Total output, total cost, and employee distribution

📌 All metrics are fully filterable by:
- Rig location  
- Week number  
- Training hours  



 🧠 Solution Design & Approach

- Automated data ingestion and transformation using Power Query
- Standardized operational, cost, quality, and training datasets
- Built a clean, performance-optimized data model
- Developed KPI, variance, and target measures using DAX
- Implemented conditional formatting for instant risk identification
- Enabled automated refresh to eliminate manual reporting



 ⚙️ Automation & Governance

- End-to-end automated data preparation after initial setup
